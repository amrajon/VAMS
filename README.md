My project VISA APPLICATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (VAMS) gives the depth solution to management of visa application in an effective way. As now we can see many of our visa application centre converted their manual management system to computerized system to get the works easier and make the solution very dynamic. Besides that, the manual visa application management system has several problems which obstruct the smooth visa application management and there is also possibility of leaking the valuable and confidential information of a visa applicant. Moreover, the manual system takes a bit longer time to processing the visa application. So, here the objectives of this projects are to develop an online visa application management system for make visa application management easier than the manual system and create a centralized database to store all the visa application information together.

The methodology I used to develop my system is RAD (Rapid Application Development).

I used ASP:NET as the framework and C# (C-Sharp) as the language and it is deployed on IIS server.
