        <h3>No Visa Required seal</h3>
        <p>
            Bangladesh missions provide a No Visa Required (NVR) seal for Bangladeshis holding foreign passport and nationality as well as to non-Bangladeshis who are descendants/relation of Bangladeshis. This seal allows the passenger to travel to Bangladesh on
            multiple occasions without restrictions on duration within the validity of the visa.
        </p>
        <p>
            The No Visa Required facility is valid until the validity of the passport and can be transferred to the new passport of the same person as required.
